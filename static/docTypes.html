            <li>
                <h1>Introduced in House/Senate</h1>
                <p>This is the first form in which a bill or resolution is shown to the full body of the House or the Senate. The legislation may be introduced in one house of Congress or both. At this stage, the legislation is likely to undergo changes if it is ever enacted, and Congress has not yet voted on the legislation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Passed House/Senate</h1>
                <p>At this stage, the bill has been voted into effect by the respective house of Congress. A bill must pass a vote in both houses of Congress in order to become law.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Reported to House/Senate</h1>
                <p>At this stage, the legislation has previously passed a vote in one house of Congress and is now sent to the other house of Congress for consideration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>House/Senate agreed to Senate/House Amendment</h1>
                <p>At this stage, the two houses of Congress have passed competing versions of the same bill. One house then agrees to the changes made by the other.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Enrolled Bill</h1>
                <p>An enrolled bill is the version of a bill that is presented to the President to either sign into law or veto. An enrolled bill is prepared only once both the House of Representatives and the Senate agree to a bill in identical form.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Public Law</h1>
                <p>The Public Law is the first truly final form of a bill. A Public Law is a bill that has been passed by both houses of Congress and either (1) signed into law by the President, or (2) vetoed by the President but subsequently passed by a supermajority of each house of Congress. It is paginated and included in the Statutes at Large edition for the respective Congress.</p>
